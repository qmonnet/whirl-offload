_This brief description of CO-RE was initially published in December 2020 by
the Cilium community as part of the
[eBPF Updates #2](https://ebpf.io/blog/ebpf-updates-2020-12) on
[ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/)._

CO-RE (_Compile Once, Run Everywhere_) is a mechanism used with eBPF to ensure
portability of the programs, mainly those intended for tracing. It addresses
the issue that arises when a given structure is modified between two kernel
versions. Tracing programs may attempt to access a field from a given structure
by reading at a specific offset in that structure. But if modifications occur
in a later version and introduce a change for the length of the structure, or
for the order of its member fields, then the program will not be compatible.

CO-RE solves this by relying on BTF objects (_BPF Type Format_). A BTF object
contains debug information about a program. This is in fact a simplified
version of the DWARF format, used for example by GDB. BTF objects are loaded
into the kernel, and they often hold information on eBPF bytecode, for example
to dump the C instructions from which the program was compiled. But BTF can
also describe other objects like the kernel itself. In that case, BTF can
provide, just before an eBPF program is loaded, the relevant information for
accessing the kernel structures. The required adjustments are performed as “ELF
relocation” steps, just before the bytecode is sent to the kernel.

The easiest way to use CO-RE is through libbpf. Note that because it needs the
BTF information for the kernel, CO-RE is only available if the
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` option has been set when compiling the kernel. Recent
tooling (LLVM, libbpf) is also necessary.

If you want more information on this topic, Andrii Nakryiko explains everything
there is to know about CO-RE
[on his blog](https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re/).
The specification for BTF can be found in
[the kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html),
but you might also want to have a look at the
[`bpftool-btf` man page](https://www.mankier.com/8/bpftool-btf) if you are
curious to inspect BTF objects on your system.
